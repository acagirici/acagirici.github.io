I have always had an interest in programming. It all started with Excel Formulas. Working in an office setting and consistently relying on data, I found that writing out formulas brought simplicity to my everyday tasks. After I learned basic formulas and started applying them, I completed work in a matter of hours while some of my other colleagues took much longer. Using excel formulas for a while, I got to the point where I found excel limiting and wanted my computer to accomplish more specific tasks. 

Then, I started looking into programming and software development. The more I read, the more intrigued I became. I was convinced that programming will open up vast opportunities for me to develop software and programs that would fit my needs. I could save my time and energy on the fun stuff: writing out code, and have my computer do the boring stuff for me. However, this idea along was not enough for me to give up everything and go into coding, as I still had to make ends meet at home. At that point, I started looking into programs that offer this as an option for people like, and I stumbled into Flatiron School. The program perfectly fit my needs, as it had the flexibility I needed. 

With no more obstacles remaining in my path, I made the commitment to pursue my growing passion for software development. I decided that learning software development would not only broaden my career options but will prepare me for an everchanging world which is fueled by constant technological advancements.
